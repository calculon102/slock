# My Personal slock-setup

I use this [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/)-configuration in my 
[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)-setup.

Technically this is a fork, but since all configuration in these suckless-
projects is done via compilation, I call it a configuration.

My changes:

* Added [message-patch](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/message/), 
changed X11-Font and default text
* Added [dpms-patch](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/dpms/) and 
changed monitor timeout to 30s
